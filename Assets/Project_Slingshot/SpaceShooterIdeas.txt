Weapons

combine weapon attributes in many fun ways

attributes scale with weapon damage[i] = damage[i] * log(sum(damage[~i]))

bullet, 
	magnetic, bullets pull enemies toward impact, med damage
	explosive, large impact with AOE, low damage
	rail gun, charge and fire, high damage
	ricochet, bounces around, loses damage per bounce
	crazy ivan, fires many small lazers within a cone/angle
	
	

laser, instant impact, damage per tick
	cold, slows enemies over time while held, less damage to slowed enemies
	hot, more damage over time while held, can overheat
	neutrino, passes through enemies, no impact effect
	tractor beam, pulls enemies towards it's center
	
	

torpedo
	smart, pathfinds to targets
	neutron, pulls enemies toward it
	kelvin, slows enemies in blast radius
	phoenix, spawns another torpedo if it kills, else a fireball
	flank, spawns smaller torpedos in opposite direction of impact
	proximity, slows down to a standstill, explodes near enemies
	thermite, high damage on single target
	propulsion, accelerates at an increasing rate, more speed == more damage


Movement

handling, ratio of average propulsion force to max speed, accel / max velocity

Retro engine, high handling, moves in mostly straight lines in cardinal directions
Propulsion engine, slightly slippery
Putter engine, small intermittent boosts of med handling
Burst engine, large burst of speed and handling that bottoms out over time to recharge
