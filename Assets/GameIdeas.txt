Idle Game

You have a power source and can control where the power goes with power lines
	power lines cost resources to create
	they have a limited throughput
		some modules require energy in minimum packets, which necessitates the use of power storage modules
Power can go to different machines/modules to make them run
	Power can go one module at a time
		Power can be split but the splitter needs some power to run so it's slightly less efficient than each, one at a time
When modules run they accumulate resources
Resources can be used in different upgrade processes
	Output per power core
	Number of power cores
	Power line section throughput
